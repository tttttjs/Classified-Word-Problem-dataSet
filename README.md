# Classified-Word-Problem-dataSet.
A classified dataset of word problem.It maybe helpful someone who want to solve the word problem.

## The difficulty of word problem.
We divide the word problme questions into 3 difficulty levels. 

***junior*** Junior word problem questions We focus on the problem-solving operators of the application questions, which often have less common sense relevance.

***medium*** The medium word problem questions are mainly reflected in the topic information and the solution is more complicated. There are several characteristics: providing more information channels (including text, tables, and graphics to extract information), the question logic information is more complex (contains common sense information, multiple sets of dynamic changes), the amount of calculation is increased, and the unknown sequence equation needs to be introduced. Or equations solving, open problem solving forms (including design options, explanation reasons, etc.)

***high*** The part of high word problem questions are closely related to high school non-word-problem questions: including series of application questions, solid geometry application questions, analytic geometry application questions, function application questions, and a small part of propositional application questions, such word problem problems are mainly used the background of the question.These question is essentially the reason for the knowledge concept of non-word_problem questions. The other part is the probabilistic word problem questions, which is mainly related to the application of probability calculation or statistical indicator solving.

## Our classification ideas
Our classification idea is based on multi-label group.When you select a label, some specific successor label group will appear.You can check the detailed classification ideas in this file.

## Finally
I hope our dataset will be helpful for you.If you have something want to say,you can leave your messege and we will response quickly.
