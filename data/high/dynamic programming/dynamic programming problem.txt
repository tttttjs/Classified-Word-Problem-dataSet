Read the following materials: In the mathematics comprehensive practice class, a group explored such a problem: xy=3 is known, and x>4, y<3, try to determine the range of values ​​of x+y. They answer this: Solution: ∵xy=3, ∴x=y+3. ∵x>4, ∴y+3>4, ∴y>1. ∵y<3, ∴1<y<3.......1 Available: 4<x<6.......2 is 4+1<x+y<3+6 from 1+2, and the range of ∴x+y is 5<x+y<9. Please follow the above method To solve the following problem: x+y=2 is known, and x>1, y>-4, try to determine the range of values ​​of xy..$$$High 5.5$$$∴x-y has a value range of 0 < x-y < 10
It is known that real numbers x and y satisfy $2x-3y=4$, and $x≥-1$, $y<2$, existing $k=x-y$, then the range of k is _____.$$$High 5.5$$$$1 ≤ k < 3$
Read the following materials: Answer "known xy = 2, and x > 1, y < 0, try to determine the range of values ​​of x + y" has the following solution: solution: ∵ xy = 2 and ∵ x > 1 ∴ y + 2 >1y>-1 and y<0, ∴-1<y<0....1 are the same: 1<x<2....2 is obtained by 1+2-1+1<y+x<0+2∴ The value range of x+y is 0<x+y<2. According to the above method, the following problem is solved: the solutions of the equations for x and y are known to be positive numbers. (1) Find the range of values ​​of a; (2) It is known that ab=4, and find the range of values ​​of a+b; (3) it is known that ab=m (m is a constant greater than 0), and b≤1, find the maximum value.
