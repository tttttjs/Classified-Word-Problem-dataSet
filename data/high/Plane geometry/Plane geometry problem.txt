As shown in the figure, Xiaofang lay a plane mirror on the straight line BM between Xiaoliang and "Wangyue Pavilion", and made a mark on the mirror surface. The corresponding position of this mark on the straight line BM is point C, the mirror does not move, small Looking at the mark on the mirror, he walked back and forth. When he reached the point D, he saw that the image of the top point A of the "Wang Yue Ge" coincided with the mark on the mirror surface. At this time, the small eyes and the ground were measured. Height ED = 1.5 meters, CD = 2 meters, then, in the sun, they used the method of measuring the length of the film for the second measurement, as follows: As shown in the figure, Xiaoliang walked 16 meters from the D point in the DM direction. Arrive at the end of the shadow of the "Wangyue Pavilion" at the point F, this elbow, measured the small bright height FG shadow length FH = 2.5 meters, FG = 1.65 meters.
