Parabola $y=-\frac{2}{3}{{x}^{2}}+\frac{7}{3}x-1$ intersects the x axis at point A, B (point A at point B) On the left side, intersect the y axis at point C, and its apex is D. Place the parabola above the line $l$:y=t(t<$\frac{25}{24}$) along the line l Under the fold, the remaining part of the parabola and the resulting figure after folding form a new image of "M" shape. (1) The coordinates of points A, B, and D are _____, _____, _____; (2) After the parabola is folded, the point D falls at the point E. When the point E is within the ΔABC (including the boundary), the range of values ​​of t is obtained; (3) as shown in Fig. 2, when t=0, if Q is On the moving point of the new image of "M" shape, is there a circle with CQ diameter that is tangent to the x-axis at point P?
