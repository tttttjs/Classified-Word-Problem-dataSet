In order to test whether the quality of the regular hexahedron dice with a number of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 is equal to each of the two six faces, under the same conditions, two tweezers were thrown at the same time for 20,000 times. The sum of the points to the top is 7 times. You think that the quality of the two dice are all qualified (the eligibility criteria are: when the dice are thrown under the same conditions, the chances of the dice facing up are equal)? Please specify reason.$$$High 7.3$$$Solution: The quality of the two dice are not qualified <img> because two dice are thrown at the same time and the following points are met: 2,3,4,5,6,7 3,4,5,6,7,8 4 ,5,6,7,8,9 5,6,7,8,9,10 6,7,8,9,10,11 7,8,9,10,11,12 So there are two points facing upwards The probability of sum and 7 is $\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}\approx 0.167$ The test 20,000 times appears two points above and the frequency of 7 is $\frac{20}{ 20000}=0.001$ Because the frequency of a large number of tests is close to the probability, and the difference between 0.001 and 0.167 is very large, the quality of the two dice is unqualified.

There are two opaque boxes, each with a number of balls identical except for the color. The first box contains 4 red balls and 6 white balls. The second box contains 6 red balls and 6 white balls. From each of these two boxes, you can find a ball. Please calculate to determine which box is likely to get a white ball.$$$High 7.3$$$Solution: P (get a white ball from the first box) =$\frac{6}{4+6}\text{=}\frac{3}{5}$ P (touch from the second box) A white ball) =$\frac{6}{6+6}\text{=}\frac{1}{2}$ ∵$\frac{3}{5}>\frac{1}{2}$可能性The possibility of touching the white ball in the first box is great.
In a box, there is one black, white and yellow ball. They are identical except for the color. Any ball is randomly drawn from the box, and the turntable is freely rotated (the turntable is divided into three equal sectors) as shown in the figure. If the ball touched from the box and the area of ​​the turntable point to the same color, then A wins; if the color is different, then B wins. Is this game fair to both A and B? If unfair, who is good? #%# <img>$$$High 7.3$$$Solution: Unfair <img> ${{P}_{(甲胜)}}=\frac{3}{9}=\frac{1}{3}$ ${{P}_{(B wins) }}=1-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{2}{3}$ $\frac{1}{3} < \frac{2}{3}$ ∴The game is unfair, pair B advantageous
In a shooting training, A, B, C, and D are each shot 10 times, and the average score is the same. The variance is ${s_{甲}}^{2}=0.35$, ${s_{B}} ^{2}=0.15$,${s_{prop}}^{2}=0.25$,${s_{丁}}^{2}=0.27$, the most stable of these 4 people is () A. A#%#B.B#%#C.C####.$$$High 7.6$$$B
Both A and B fired 10 times under the same conditions, and their average scores were the same. The variances were ${{}}{{}}^{2}=0.2$, ${{S}_{B }}^{2}=0.5$, then it is _____ (fill in "A" or "B") for the two players.$$$High 7.6$$$A
As shown in the figure, in ΔABC, ∠C=90°, AC=3cm, BC=4cm, the moving point P moves from point B to point C at a speed of 2cm/s, and the moving point Q starts from C at 1cm/s. The speed moves to point A. If the moving points P and Q start at the same time, what is the time required to make ΔCPQ and △CBA similar? #%#<img>$$$7$$$Verification shows that the t obtained in both cases satisfies the condition in both cases. Therefore, it can be seen that the time required for ΔCPQ is similar to ΔCBA, and the time required is 1.2 or second.
