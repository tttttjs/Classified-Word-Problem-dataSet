(2014 Hulunbeier) The road from A to B has an uphill slope and a downhill slope. If the average slope is 50 meters per minute and the downhill average is 100 meters per minute, then it takes 25 from A to B. Minutes, it takes 20 minutes to walk from B to A. What is the distance between Qishang and B to the uphill and downhill?$$$17.2$$$Solution: Set the land to the land slope to be x meters, and the downhill road to have y meters. According to the meaning of the question, get $\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\frac{{{x }}}{{50}} + \frac{{{}}}{{100}} = 25} \\{\frac{{{y}}}{{50}} + \frac{{{x }}}{{100}} = 20} \end{array}} \right.$ Solve $\left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {x = 1000} \\ {y = 500} \end{array}} \right.$ A: There is 1000 meters on the uphill road to the land and 500 meters on the downhill road.
Before the New Year's Day party, a class was arranged in a classroom. The students used a colored paper strip to form a colored paper chain. Xiaoying measured the length of some colored paper chains. The data she obtained is as follows: #%#(1)猜想x , the functional relationship between y, and find the functional relationship; #%# (2) classroom ceiling diagonal length of 10m, now need to pull a color paper chain along the diagonal of the ceiling, then at least how much paper is needed Ring?#%#<img>$$$17.2$$$Solution: (1) It is assumed by the image that the relationship between y and x satisfies a linear relationship. The straight line of (1, 19), (2, 36) is y=kx+b, then $\left\{\begin {array}{*{35}{l}}k+b=19\\2k+b=36\\\end{array} \right.$ Solve $\left\{{\begin{array}{* {20}{l}}{k = 17}\\{b=2}\end{array}} \right.$ ∴y=17x+2 When x=3, y=17×3+2=53 When x=4, y=17×4+2=70 ∴(3,53)(4,70) are the length y(cm) of the enamel paper chain on the image of the first function y=17x+2 The number of paper rings x (s) satisfies a linear function relationship y=17x+2 (2)10m=1000cm, according to the meaning of the question, get 17x+2≥1000 solution x≥58$\frac{12}{17}$ 59×2=118(a) Answer: At least 118 paper rings per color paper chain

If the ratio of the length can be expressed as an integer ratio, the sound is emitted. The sound is more harmonious. For example, the ratio of the lengths of the three strings is $15:12:10$, and they are stretched tightly, and they are plucked with the same force, and they will emit very harmonious music, do, mi, and so. The reciprocal of the three numbers of 12, 10 is found: $\frac{1}{12}-\frac{1}{15}=\frac{1}{10}-\frac{1}{12}$. We call the three numbers 15, 12, and 10 as a set of harmonics.
