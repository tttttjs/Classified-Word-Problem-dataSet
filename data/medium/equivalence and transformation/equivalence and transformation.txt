The area of ​​colored paper of Qufu and Qumi is different. How many square meters is it?$$$33.1$$$84×6=504 (square decimeter) 0.84×0.6=0.504 (square decimeter) Answer: Qufu's colored paper area is 504 square decimeters, and Qumi's colored paper area is 0.504 square decimeters.
Every weekend, winter and winter have to go to the flower garden of the grandfather's house in the suburbs. Once, the grandfather gave a math problem to the winter and winter. The flower bed of the grandfather's family is rectangular, and the length is 2m wider than the width. If the length and width of the flower bed are Increase by 3m, then the area of ​​this flower garden will increase by $39{{m}^{2}}$. Can you calculate the length and width of the flowerbed?$$$33.1$$$Solution: If the original width of the flower bud is xm, the length is (x+2)m. According to the meaning of the question: (x+3)(x+2+3)-x(x+2)=39 x=4 ∴ 4+2=6m A: The original length of the flower bud is 6m and the width is 4m.

As shown in the figure, the main gas pipeline of a natural gas company passes through the A community and continues to lay in the direction of 60° north east of the A community. The surveyor measured another M cell that needs to install natural gas at A. In the direction of °, the surveyor starts from A and walks 2000 meters along the main gas pipeline to reach C. At this time, the M community is located 60° west to west. Now select a branch pipe connection on the main gas pipeline AC. Point N, the pipe from N to M cell is the shortest. #%#(1) Q: When the MN and AC meet the positional relationship, the pipe from N to M is the shortest?$$$33.2$$$Solution: (1) When MN⊥AC, the pipe laid from N to M cell is the shortest (2)∵∠MAC=60°-30°=30°, ∠ACM=30°+30°=60° ∴∠AMC =180°-30°-60°=90° In RtΔAMC, ∵∠AMC=90°, ∠MAC=30°, AC=2000 ∴AM=AC•cos∠MAC=$2000\times \frac{\ Sqrt{3}}{2}=1000\sqrt{3}$ In RtΔAMN, ∵∠ANM=90°, cos30°=$\frac{AN}{AM}$ ∴AN=AM⋅cos30°= $1000\sqrt{3}\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$=1500(m) Answer: ∠AMC is equal to 90°, AN is 1500 meters long
