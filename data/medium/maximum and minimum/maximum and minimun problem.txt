Ask how to design (find two The distance between the sprinklers and the length and width of the rectangle $), can the area of ​​the rectangular flower bed be the largest?$$$29.1$$$Solution: Figure: ${{O}_{1}}$${{O}_{2}}$ is the location of two identical sprinklers, $ABCD$ is the design of the rectangular flowerbed with a rectangular side length $AD=x$m, then $PQ=AD=x$m in $Rt\vartriangle {{O}_{1}}EQ$, ${{O}_{1}}E=\sqrt{{ {{O}_{1}{Q}}^{2}}-{{QE}^{2}}}=\sqrt{{{10}^{2}}-{{\left( \frac{ x}{2} \right)}^{2}}}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{400-{{x}^{2}}}$ ∴ center distance ${{O}_{ 1}}{{O}_{2}}=2{{O}_{1}}E=\sqrt{400-{{x}^{2}}}$ $AB=2{{O}_ {1}}{{O}_{2}}=2\sqrt{400-{{x}^{2}}}$ ∴Rectangle area $S=2x\sqrt{400-{{x}^{2 }}}\left( 0 < x < 20 \right)$ ∵${{S}^{2}}=4{{x}^{2}}\left( 400-{{x}^{2 }} \right)=-{{\left( 2{{}}{2}}-400 \right)}^{2}}+{{400}^{2}}$ ∴当$2{{x }^{2}}-400=0$, ${{}}{2}}$ is the largest at this time $x=10\sqrt{2}$ (m), ${{S}^{2 }}$ is the largest, and the maximum value of S is 400. Therefore, the design that meets the requirements is that the distance between the two sprinklers is ${{O}_{1}}{{O}_{2}}=\sqrt{ 400-{{\left( 10\sqrt{2} \right)}^{2}}}=10\sqrt{2}$ (m), both sides of the rectangle are $AD=10\sqrt{2}$.m , $AB=20\sqrt{2}$ m, the rectangular flower bed has the largest area
