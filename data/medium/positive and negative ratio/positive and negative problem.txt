The beauty of mathematics is ubiquitous. The mathematicians have found that the pitch of the sound of the plucked string depends on the length of the string. For example, the ratio of the length of the three strings is 15:12:10, and they are stretched tightly. The same force plucks the strings, they can make a very harmonious tone, study the reciprocal of these three numbers: $\frac{1}{12}-\frac{1}{15}=\frac{1}{ 10}-\frac{1}{12}$, at this time we call the three numbers 15, 12, and 10 as a set of harmonic numbers. There are three numbers: 5, 3, and x (x>5). To form a set of harmonics, the value of x is _____.$$$16.2$$$15
