On the top platform of Zhuhai Mountain Forest Park (also known as the Macao Return Park), there is a hundred returning monument. The hundred returning monument is a brief history of Macao in the past 100 years, recording the major historical events of Macao in recent years and related historical sites, humanities. Information, such as the central four consecutive reading for the 1999-12-20 mark Macao return date, the central low-end 23-50 mark Macao area is about 23.50 square kilometers. The hundred returning monument is a ten-order magic square, is by 1 A total of 100 integers filled with 100 spaces, the sum of the horizontal numbers and the sum of the inline numbers and the diagonal numbers are equal. I would like to ask the number on the diagonal line in Figure 2 (from top left to bottom right) And for _____.$$$26$$$505
Fill the 1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3 nine digits into a 3×3 square to form a third-order magic square (the rows, columns, and diagonals) The sum of the numbers is equal.) If the magic square is folded in half along a certain axis of symmetry and the numbers in the symmetrical position are the same, then the magic square is called "symmetric magic square". Please make a symmetrical magic square and say a few Symmetry axis.#%#<img>$$$26.2$$$1 axis of symmetry
