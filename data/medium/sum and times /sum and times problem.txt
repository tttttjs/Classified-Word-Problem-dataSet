How many people are there in the two tour groups?$$$4.2$$$Solution: If the number of people does not exceed 100, the cost is up to 13,000 yuan. Therefore, the total number of two tour groups exceeds 100 and 10080÷90=112. The total number of two tour groups is 112. For x people, y people by x+y=112, know that x, y at least one is greater than 50 and $112×110=12320 < 13140$, we know that x and y will not be greater than 50. If a tour group has more than 100 people When there are less than 12 people in another tour group, the total amount of tickets is at most $9000+130×12=10560 < 13140$. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is no more than 50 people in one tour group, and more than 50 people in another tour group. More than 100 people may wish to set 1 ≤ x ≤ 50, 51 ≤ y ≤ 100, then: $\left\{ \begin{gathered} x+y=112 \\ 130x+110y=13140 \\ \end{gathered} \ Right.$ Solution: $\left\{ \begin{gathered} x=41 \\ y=71 \\ \end{gathered} \right.$ 人数The number of the two tour groups is 41 and 71 respectively
