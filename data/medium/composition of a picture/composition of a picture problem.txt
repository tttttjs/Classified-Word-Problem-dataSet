A Hannota game has evolved from the legend of the ancient Indian Tower of Hanno: (1) There are three poles A, B, C, and B with three dishes (ranging from top to bottom, from small to large) , as shown in Fig. #%#(2) Each time you move a dish, the small one can only be stacked on the top of the big one. #%#(3) Move all the dishes from the A-bar to the C-rod. Try to design an algorithm to complete Above game.#%#$$$25$$$<img>
There are 50 students in a class. In a math test, you should search for the results of the passing test (60 points or more), try to design an algorithm, and draw a block diagram.$$$25$$$<img>
When designing an algorithm for calculating the value of 1×2×3×...×10, the following statement is correct ( )A, only one multiplication variable and one count variable #%#B, the initial value of the multiplication variable is set to 0. #%#C, the value of the count variable cannot be 1#%#D, and the block diagram can be drawn only by the loop structure###$$$25$$$A
"Nine Chapters of Arithmetic" is a masterpiece of ancient Chinese mathematics, which embodies the wisdom of the ancient working people in mathematics. Among them, the sixth chapter "all loses" has a bamboo capacity problem, and a teacher designs according to the idea of ​​this problem. The block diagram, if the value of $m$ is 35, the value of $\text{a}$ is ()A, 4#%#B, 5#%#C, 7#%#D, 11#%#$$$25$$$D
The actual background of the design represents the inequality: $0.3x+0.5y\leqslant 8$.$$$25$$$The price of a notebook in a store is 0.5 yuan, 0.3 yuan per pencil, Xiao Ming brought 8 yuan, bought x pencils and y notebooks (the answer is not unique)
A scientist designed a strange clock. This strange clock is 10 o'clock every day at 10 o'clock (as shown on the right). When this clock shows 5 o'clock, it is actually 12 o'clock at noon; when this clock shows 6:75, what time is it actually?$$$25$$$4:12
